# ⚡ Vite React SSG Pro Template

> **Note:** Some files (such as config, scripts, or generated files) may be hidden in your editor due to workspace settings in `.vscode/settings.json`. If you don't see a file, check your folder and VS Code settings.

> **Note:** This template is a static site generator (SSG) that prerenders all routes to static HTML at build time. It does not provide runtime SSR (server-side rendering). All output is fully static and deployable to any static host.

## 🚀 Why This Template is Epic

### The Problem We Solve
Most React apps fail at SEO because they're client-side rendered. Traditional SSR solutions require Node.js servers ($$$) and complex infrastructure. This template gives you the **best of both worlds**:

✅ **Perfect SEO** - Pre-rendered HTML for every page  
✅ **Lightning Fast** - Static files served from CDN  
✅ **Zero Backend** - Deploy anywhere (Cloudflare)  
✅ **Free hosting** - Static hosting is practically free  
✅ **Google Loves It** - Perfect Lighthouse scores out of the box
